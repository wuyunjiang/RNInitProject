# Lib

At first glance, this could appear to be a "miscellaneous" folder, but we recommend that you treat this as proving ground for components that could be reusable outside your project.
乍一看，这似乎是一个“杂项”文件夹，但我们建议您将其作为可在项目外部重用的组件的试验场。

Maybe you're writing a set of utilities that you could use outside your project, but they're not quite ready or battle tested.  This folder would be a great place to put them.  They ideally be pure functions have no dependencies on other things in your App folder.
也许您正在编写一组实用程序，您可以在项目之外使用它们，但是它们还没有完全准备好或经过测试。这个文件夹将是放置它们的好地方。理想情况下，它们是纯函数，不依赖于App文件夹中的其他内容。
